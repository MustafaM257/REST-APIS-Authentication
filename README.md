**Project: Scalable Authentication System and REST API Starter**

**Introduction**

This project serves as a boilerplate for efficiently building robust authentication systems and REST APIs using Node.js and TypeScript. It provides a solid foundation for rapid development, ensuring clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

**Technologies Used**

- `body-parser`: Middleware for parsing request bodies
- `compression`: Enables response compression for improved performance
- `cookie-parser`: Middleware for handling cookies (v1.4.6)
- `cors`: Middleware for configuring Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file
- `express`: Popular web framework for building Node.js applications
- `lodash`: Utility library for common programming tasks
- `mongoose`: Object Document Mapper (ODM) for interacting with MongoDB

**Project Structure**

The project follows a well-organized structure to promote modularity and maintainability:

```
src/
├── db/          // Contains Mongoose models for data persistence
├── controllers/ // Implements business logic and API endpoints
├── router/      // Handles routing and maps API endpoints to controllers
├── utils/       // Houses helper functions and reusable utilities
└── middlewares/ // Contains middleware functions to handle cross-cutting concerns
```

2. **Install PNPM (Recommended):**

   PNPM is a recommended package manager for this project because it offers benefits like:

   - Fast installation and updates
   - Efficient dependency management
   - Flat dependency tree for easier debugging

   **Installation Instructions:**

   Follow the official installation instructions from PNPM documentation: [https://pnpm.io/installation](https://pnpm.io/installation)

3. **Alternative Package Managers:**

   While PNPM is recommended, you can also use your preferred package manager like `npm` or `yarn`. However, be aware that these alternatives might require additional configuration or may encounter compatibility issues with the project's dependencies.

4. **Set Up Environment:**

   - Create a file named `.env` in your project's root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables, replacing placeholders with your actual values:

     ```
     MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     SECRET=<your-secret-for-encoding-password>
     ```

     - `MONGO_URI`: Your MongoDB connection URI.
     - `SECRET`: A secure secret key for password encoding.

5. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Open a terminal in the project directory.
   - Run `pnpm install` to install all project dependencies.

6. **Start Development:**

   - Run `pnpm nodemon` to start the development server using Nodemon for automatic restarts upon code changes.
